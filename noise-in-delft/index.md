## Measuring Delft’s Soundscape: Mount a sensor and learn about noise around your home

Noise pollution is a huge burden for citizens in the urban environment. Not only does noise cause stress and annoyance, it also contributes to negative health outcomes such as heart desease and sleeping problems. To mitigate noise one must understand the soundscape of our cities. While traffic noise is often perceived as a nuisance, bird song may have a restorative effect on our well-being. Therefore, we want to not only measure sound levels in Delft, but also detect the sound sources, such as traffic, birds, or crowds. For this, we need the help of curious citizens who are willing to install one of our sensors outside their home.

### How it works
{: #how}
The soundscape sensor was developed internally at TU Delft. The devices are solar-powered and do not need access to power. With your help, we can gather valuable information about the sounds of Delft.

What do we measure?
 - Loudness (dB(A)): This tells us how loud it is, using decibels adjusted to human hearing.
 - Sound Source Detection: Our sensor recognizes whether the noise comes from traffic, birds, people, or other sources.
 - Intermittency Ratio: This helps us understand if the noise is constant (like steady traffic) or comes in bursts (like a single passing scooter).
 - Sharpness: Sharpness is similar to the pitch of a sound. Specifically, it reflects the amount of high-frequency components.

How does it work?
 - We provide a sensor and install it with you at a suitable location at your home.
 - The sensor will remain installed for about 4–5 weeks.
 - We will also kindly ask you to fill in a short survey on noise annoyance.
 - After completion of the project, you’ll receive a short report summarizing the noise characteristics at your location.

Note that your neighborhood does not need to be particularly noisy to participate. We are interested in both, pleasent and unpleasend soundscapes.
