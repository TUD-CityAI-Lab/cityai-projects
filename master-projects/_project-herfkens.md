    <p>
My thesis aims to bridge a critical gap in sustainable urban planning by integrating advanced soundscape analysis with deep learning techniques. It focuses on adapting the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a cutting-edge, attention-based model, to predict eight perceptual attributes of urban soundscapes: Pleasant, Vibrant, Eventful, Chaotic, Annoying, Monotonous, Uneventful, and Calm. I will use the data provided by the International Soundscape Database, which includes audio recordings accompanied by in situ perceptual ratings, the research begins by converting raw audio into Mel-spectrograms, the preferred input format for the AST. The model is then adapted by modifying its final layer to output predictions corresponding to each of the eight attributes. By employing deep learning and explainable AI techniques, the research aims to provide urban planners with actionable insights to design healthier, more liveable urban environments.
