    <p>
With exponential growth of cities, the demand for suitable residential development for inhabitants is a challenge. Moreover, residential location preferences play a pivotal role in the discussion on high density urban planning. But provision of all amenities is a difficult task considering the paucity of land as a resource; therefore, residents are required to choose among them. Having an affinity to personal green spaces as well as a proximal parking space, residents certainly exhibit different priorities, having cascading implications on the spatial development paradigms. But what preferences and trade-offs do different people make within these microscopic residential choice attributes? To delve deeper into peopleâ€™s preference for such accessibility and the heterogeneity thereof across segments of the population, I will conduct a stated choice experiment, in which people will experience trade-offs between residential amenities, accessibility and price (incorporating street imagery). Subsequently, I will extract insights from the data using traditional discrete choice models and state-of-the-art computer vision-enriched discrete choice models. These insights, reinforced with segment-specific preferences and sensitivities, shall be used by the municipalities to propose suitable policy interventions.
