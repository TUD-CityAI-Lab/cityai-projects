    <p>
      Ensuring cycling safety in urban areas is crucial for promoting sustainable transport. Demographic differences, including age, income, gender and cultural background, can have a significant impact on how individuals perceive cycling safety. The proposed methodology, using Google Street View imagery and discrete choice modelling, allows for the creation of a map of perceived safety for each cycle route in Rotterdam. Discrete choice modelling can then be used to see how the public space ensures safety by extracting different attributes from the image. With the demographic data and the influence of the public space on safety, a comprehensive analysis of cycling safety can be made. This can be used to advise the municipality of Rotterdam on how to promote cycling.
