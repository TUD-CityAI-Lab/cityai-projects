    <p>
It is well-known that cycling infrastructure's safety plays an important role in peoples' decisions to make a trip by bike or another mode (e.g. car). As such, safe cycling infrastructure is crucial for promoting sustainable transport. Moreover, what is considered a safe cycling infrastructure varies across demographic segments of the population, including age, income, gender and cultural background. But what does safe cycling infrastructure look like, and to whom? In my research, I will conduct a stated choice experiment in which people face trade-offs between travel time and cycling infrastructure (as presented using street-view images). Using discrete choice models I gather new insights into the preferences of people over cycling infrastructure. Next, I'll use estimated choice models to produce maps showing utility-based safety scores for cycling routes in Rotterdam. I hope my study delivers insights that the municipality of Rotterdam can use to devise policies aiming to promote cycling.
