    <p>
It is well-known that cycling infrastructure's safety plays an important role in peoples' decisions to make a trip by bike or another mode (e.g. car). As such, safe cycling infrastructure is crucial for promoting sustainable transport. But what does safe cycling infrastructure look like, and to whom? What is considered a safe cycling infrastructure by young people may feel unsafe to older people, or vice versa. To shed light on people's preferences for cycling infrastructure, I will conduct a stated choice experiment in which people face trade-offs between travel time and cycling infrastructure (as presented using street-view images). Then, I'll analyse these data using discrete choice models. Finally, I'll use the estimated discrete choice models to produce maps showing utility-based safety scores for cycling routes in Rotterdam. I hope my study delivers insights that the municipality of Rotterdam can use to devise policies aiming to promote cycling.
