    <p>
      Liveability in cities influences multiple factors in citizensâ€™ lives positively, and with increasing urbanization, liveable cities become vital. Liveability is in the literature mostly described as perceived liveability, so what parts (physical, social, economical, sustainable) influence the perceived liveability of citizens. In my thesis, I leverage a computer vision model for modeling liveability, which is preferred liveability, instead of perceived liveability. Thus, liveability is measured by what a person deems more liveable than another place. I use street view images as input for the computer vision model. In my thesis, I focus on using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques for interpreting the results from the model. Via this, I will investigate whether the use of these models with XAI is useful for municipalities as policy tools and if so, how they should use it.
