    <p>
      Keeping cities liveable is increasingly a challenge with increasing urbanisation. Most literature on liveability concerns **perceived** liveability: they study what factors, e.g. physical, social, or economic, impact peoples' liveability perceptions. Perceptions are subjective interpretations of sensory stimuli, which may influence but do not necessarily determine individuals' choice behaviour. In contrast, I study preference-based liveability. Preferences govern what people choose and do. More specifically, I aim to provide explanations for predictions made by a recently developed computer vision-enriched discrete choice model. This model produces preference-based liveability scores, taking street-view images as inputs. To achieve this, I will assess the efficacy of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as LIME and Shapley. Also, I will investigate how the combination of computer vision-enriched discrete choice models and XAI can effectively be used by municipalities to support policy-making.
