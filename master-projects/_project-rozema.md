    <p>
My Thesis is about validating if the utility derived from the CV-model, created by Sander, does correlate with life satisfaction in the same way previous research has measured this correlation. Why is this needed: it is hard to objectively measure the physical appearence of a built environment due to the subjective nature of how people perceive things. With this CV-model this is overcome since it derives utilty from an image, making it a unique tool to quantify the quality of one's built environment, which was previously not possible. However before it can be used as a tool, it should be validated if it indeed measures the correct things and to assure it is in line with previousÂ research
