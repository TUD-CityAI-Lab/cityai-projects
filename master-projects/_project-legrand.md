    <p>
      Construction-related noise pollution is a major concern for policy makers around the world. To address this, the municipality of Amsterdam has deployed noise sensors to monitor noise levels around construction sites. Two types of sensors have been deployed: one more expensive (and presumably more accurate) by sensor company Munisense, and another by TU Delft’s CityAI Lab. This thesis will make use of three methods of analysis to compare their ability to measure and address construction noise pollution. First, a comparative analysis of each sensor’s output data will be made to find the strengths, weaknesses and particularities of each sensor, followed by a survey to be distributed near the sites to evaluate residents’ sentiment, and to finish a geographical analysis using GIS to understand the impact of urban form on noise pollution monitoring. The conclusions from this study will help researchers improve their understanding of construction-related noise pollution and noise sensing methods, and help policymakers in Amsterdam and elsewhere to monitor and mitigate noise pollution.
