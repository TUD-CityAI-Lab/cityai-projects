    <p>
      To promote public transport use, the Municipality of Rotterdam wants to better align the design of metro stations with the preferences of travellers. The layout, atmosphere, surrounding amenities, and transfer time at a station can all play an important role in how people use and perceive public transport. In this project, you will develop a stated choice experiment that combines images with key attributes, such as transfer time and amenities, to elicit travellers’ preferences for different metro station designs. The results will provide insights to help the municipality design safer, more attractive and user-friendly metro stations.
