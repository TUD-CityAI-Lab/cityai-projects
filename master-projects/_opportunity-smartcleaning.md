    <p>
      How can we predict operational resource demand for street cleaning using data and AI? The municipality of Rotterdam currently allocates cleaning teams and equipment largely based on surface area and professional judgement. However, factors such as weather conditions, tree coverage, seasonal variation, and local land use significantly influence how quickly streets become dirty. In this thesis, you will develop a data-driven predictive model to estimate the required operational resources for street cleaning. The model will use inputs such as street view imagery, GIS data (e.g. tree locations, land use), weather data, cleaning equipment records, and inspection reports. A key objective is to generate interpretable insights into which factors most strongly influence resource demand, thereby supporting more efficient and evidence-based planning of street cleaning operations.
