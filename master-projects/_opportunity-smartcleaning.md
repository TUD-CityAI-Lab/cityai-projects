    <p>
      How can we predict how much cleaning staff for street cleaning is needed using data and AI? The municipality of Rotterdam currently allocates cleaning staff mostly based on surface area and experience-based judgement. Yet, factors such as weather conditions, tree coverage, seasonality, and local land use have a significant impact on how quickly streets become dirty. In this thesis, you will develop a predictive model to estimate workforce demand for street cleaning, using inputs like street view images, GIS data (trees location, land use), weather data, cleaning equipment data and inspection records. You will also analyse which variables affect the amount of cleaning staff required, offering interpretable insights for planning. This work will support more efficient and data-driven deployment of cleaning staff.
