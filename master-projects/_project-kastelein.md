    <p>
      Whenever we walk through a city, whether taking the fastest route or going for an easy stroll, we are often drawn to streets that feel greener, safer, or simply more pleasant to walk through. This thesis explores how such visual street attributes influence pedestrian route choice. I will conduct a stated-choice experiment where participants will choose between different walking routes based on traditional factors, such as distance or travel time, as well as visual attributes represented by street-view images. The collected data will be analysed using discrete choice models, including a computer vision-enriched discrete choice model. This thesis is in collaboration with the Sustainable Urban Development department of TNO, which is developing a transport model for Amsterdam-Zuid. The results will provide insights into pedestrian route preferences and can be used to evaluate the perceived quality of walking routes. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to more behaviorally realistic pedestrian route choice modelling that can inform urban design and policy for more livable and walkable cities.
