    <p>
      Amsterdam is a fast growing city, which leads to a large number of demolitions and construction sites. While necessary for development, these activities also create significant noise pollution. To better understand construction noise, the City of Amsterdam and the AMS Institute deployed noise sensors at several building sites. These sensors, developed by us at the CityAI Lab, measure loudness and classify sound events into onstruction-related categories (e.g., piling, drilling). However, it remains  unclear how reliable these sensors capture construction noise, how impactful the noise is for residents, and how cities could incorporate such sensor data in their decision-making. In this project, you will analyze the collected data and explore one or more of these questions. Your insights will contribute to innovations within the City of Amsterdam.
