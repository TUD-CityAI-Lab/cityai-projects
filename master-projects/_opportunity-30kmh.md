    <p>
      The city of Rotterdam wants to reduce the speed limit to 30 km/h in 115 additional streets to improve traffic safety. While this policy is aimed at reducing accidents, its broader impact on perceived safety — by both residents and drivers — is not well understood. Some car users express frustration, while cyclists and pedestrians may feel safer. In this thesis, you will design a stated choice experiment, potentially using video-based scenarios, to measure how different speed limits affect people’s perception of safety. This helps the municipality to evaluate and communicate the effects of speed policies more effectively.
