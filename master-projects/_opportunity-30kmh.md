    <h4 id="perceived-safety-30kmh">Evaluating perceived safety impacts of urban speed limit policies</h4>
    <p>
      The city of Rotterdam wants to reduce the speed limit to 30 km/h on 115 additional streets as part of its efforts to improve traffic safety. While the primary goal of this policy is to reduce accidents, its broader impact on perceived safety among residents and road users remains unclear. Some motorists express frustration, whereas cyclists and pedestrians may feel more at ease. In this thesis, you will design a stated choice experiment—potentially incorporating video-based scenarios—to investigate how different speed limits influence people’s perceptions of safety across various user groups. The results will help the municipality better understand public responses to speed policies and support more effective communication and evaluation of their outcomes.
