    <p>
Public and private organizations are increasingly challenged to make structured decisions based on unstructured information, such as contract texts or case descriptions. Councyl, a Dutch decision-support company, develops discrete choice models that incorporate expert judgment into daily workflows in areas like legal and risk assessment. In collaboration with Councyl and Antea Group, this thesis examines whether large language models (LLMs) can support the process of converting free-text documents into model-ready attributes. Using a Design Science Research approach, the study analyzes the existing expert workflow, designs an LLM-based structuring module, and evaluates its performance against human input in terms of quality, efficiency, transparency, and adaptability. The results will provide insights into the feasibility of integrating LLMs into decision-support systems in the public sector, highlighting opportunities for more scalable and transparent policy analysis.
