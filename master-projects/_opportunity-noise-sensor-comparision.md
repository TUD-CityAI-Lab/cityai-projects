    <p>
      Noise is one of the most harmful urban pollutants and  contributes to the risk of heart diseases, insomnia and the impaired cognitive development of children. Cities typically rely on professional noise measurement equipment, which is ery accurate but expensive and therefore limited in coverage. In contrast, low cost sensors can be distributed on a large scale, but may be less accurate. Purpose of this project is to compare or combine measurements from high end devices and low-cost sensor. Your Insights into differences between them, and how they can enrich each other, can help to gain a more complete picture into urban noise pollution. You may also have the opportunity to interview relevant experts and stakeholders to understand their demands and how this relates to different measurement approaches.
