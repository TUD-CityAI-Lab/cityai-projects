    <p>
The energy transition and increasing electrification require more transformer houses to ensure a stable electricity grid. Expanding their number will help meet rising energy demand (e.g., from electric vehicles) and increasing local supply (e.g., solar power). The municipality of Rotterdam has developed a framework for selecting transformer house locations, incorporating technical and some social considerations. However, the Dutch citizens’ preferences and their quantifcations regarding the visual and locational aspects of these structures are still unknown. As a result, public dissatisfaction can lead to complaints, delaying the energy transition. My thesis examines residents' preferences for both location attributes—such as placement on a parking lot versus replacing a tree—and transformer attributes like color. Through a stated choice experiment, I will analyze how in general Dutch citizens value different factors and the trade-offs they are willing to make. These insights could improve the site selection framework by incorporating social considerations or strengthening public communication on location choices.
