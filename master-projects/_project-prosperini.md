    <p>
The problem of naastplaatsing, improper disposal of waste next to municipal containers, is one of the main challenges facing the municipality of Rotterdam. Multiple crews (nietRnaast initiative) are deployed every day to canvass all the containers in the city, imposing additional operational costs on municipal waste disposal. Naastplaatsing also contributes to eroding public trust in waste management organizations, discouraging proper waste disposal among the rest of the community.

This thesis sets out to analyze the phenomenon of naastplaatsing through the development of a causal model, which will investigate which factors contribute the most to naastplaatsing. This analysis is supported by an exploration of the problem domain through expert knowledge gathered with stakeholders that are working (or have worked) with naastplaatsing. Furthermore, a predictive Machine Learning model will be developed to assign probabilities of naastplaatsing to all the municipal containers of Rotterdam. The results of this model are to be used to optimize the routes of the nietRnaast crews through the containers they visit every day.
