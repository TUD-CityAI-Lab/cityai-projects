    <p>
      The number of traffic accidents in Rotterdam has been increasing for over a decade, with a large share taking place at intersections. While it's clear that both behavior and infrastructure matter, it remains uncertain which specific factors contribute most to intersection safety. In this thesis, you will analyse accident data, including information on transport modes, time of day, in combination with urban spatial data such as road layout, land use, and traffic intensity. The goal is to build a model that identifies patterns in accident risk and explains why some intersections are more dangerous than others. Your findings will support targeted, data-driven interventions to improve traffic safety on intersections in Rotterdam.
