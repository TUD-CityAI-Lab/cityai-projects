    <h4 id="yuxiao-ma">Prediction of urban noise levels: A machine learning approach combining street view images with field sound sampling</h4>
    <p>
Urban noise pollution is an increasing environmental problem with significant impacts on public health and quality of life. The conventional methods of noise monitoring could not provide an adequate appraisal of the urban noise because they are relatively expensive and have sparse spatial coverage. To address this gap, I will develop a new approach comparing SVR, RF, GBRT, CNN, combining street view imagery with real-time sound sampling to predict noise levels in Dutch cities. I'll use an Insta360 X4 camera to coalesce audio and visual data from diverse spaces at three different times of the day for temporal differences with the pair of noise levels throughout the day. Visual features such as road structure, building density, and vegetation will be extracted using deep learning models (namely, Faster R-CNN, PSPNet, and CNN); acoustic metrics (namely, equivalent sound level (Leq) and Zwick loudness) will quantify noise intensity. To achieve my goal of estimating noise levels across multiple domains, I will combine these multimodal data sources and develop predictive models that apply to unmonitored areas based solely on Google Street View imagery. It will create noise maps which will enable municipalities to identify hotspots and implement targeted mitigation strategies that will make urban environments healthier.
