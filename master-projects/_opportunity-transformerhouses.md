    <p>
      The deployment of large numbers of new transformer houses is crucial to power the energy transition. However, space in urban environments is scarce. Finding a suitable location therefore involves trade-offs between ecology (e.g. sacrificing a tree), mobility (e.g. removing a parking space), citizen preferences (e.g. deteriorating the attractiveness of a street), and deployment costs (e.g. choosing between a standard metal unit or a custom brick structure). This project investigates these trade-offs using stated choice experiments with key stakeholders such as municipal officials and grid operators, aiming to support more transparent and informed decision-making.
