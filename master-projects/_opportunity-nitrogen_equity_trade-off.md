    <h4 id="Nitrogen_equity_trade-off">Understanding peoples' preferences for cost-efficiency and equity of nitrogen deposition reduction measures</h4>
    <p>
      The Netherlands faces significant challenges in reducing nitrogen deposition to comply with environmental regulations. Billions of euros are allocated to buy out farmers and reduce livestock numbers to lower nitrogen emissions in environmentally threatened areas, see e.g. this recent <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2597967-uitkoopregeling-boeren-had-1-5-miljard-goedkoper-gekund"

        article</a>. The government thus needs to trade-off the cost-efficiency of these measures (minimising overall costs by buying out the biggest contributors) with equity considerations (fair distribution of costs and benefits across different regions and communities). How should these trade-offs be made according to citizens?
    </p>
      This project aims to understand how <strong>citizens</strong> feel that the government should trade-offs between cost-efficiency and equity in nitrogen deposition reduction strategies. Through a stated choice experiment, the project will gather insights into citizens preferences, which can inform policymakers in designing balanced and acceptable nitrogen reduction policies.
