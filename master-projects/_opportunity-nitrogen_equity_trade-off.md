    <p>
      The Netherlands faces significant challenges in reducing nitrogen deposition to comply with environmental regulations. Various measures can be implemented to achieve these reductions, each with different cost implications and impacts on different regions and sectors. This project aims to understand how citizens feel that the government should trade-offs between cost-efficiency (minimizing overall costs) and equity (fair distribution of costs and benefits) in nitrogen deposition reduction strategies. Through a stated choice experiment, the project will gather insights into citizens preferences, which can inform policymakers in designing balanced and acceptable nitrogen reduction policies.
