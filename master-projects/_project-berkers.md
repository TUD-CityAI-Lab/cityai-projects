    <p>
      Transport policy is increasingly studied through the lens of broad prosperity and livability. The <a href="https://www.leefbaarometer.nl/home.php">Leefbaarometer</a> offers a robust operationalisation of livability, combining indicators that describe geographic areas (assumed liveability) and people’s subjective valuations (perceived livability). Making the Leefbaarometer a form of ‘apparent livability’. 
      However, creating, updating, and collecting the data behind these indicators and valuations remains labour-intensive. Machine learning could streamline this process and reduce the effort involved. Urban representation learning transforms complex data into simpler numerical forms for analysis. 
      My thesis explores the creation of urban representations using diverse data sources, including street-view images and road network characteristics. It also considers how the connectivity of multi-modal transport networks (walking, cycling, driving, and public transport) can guide the learning process. These representations will be examined for their ability to accurately predict Leefbaarometer scores and their components.
