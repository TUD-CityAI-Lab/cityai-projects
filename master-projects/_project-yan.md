    <p>
      Visual aids play a crucial role in many multi-attribute decision scenarios, as they provide information that texts and numbers alone cannot convey. In the context of residential location choice, images capturing the surrounding built environment (BE) near residences offer the most direct means for individuals to understand the visual representation of potential living spaces. However, BE features are hard to quantify and incorporate in choice modelling as most are amorphous. Leveraging computer vision, this thesis proposes an approach that integrates a computer-vision model to quantify BE features in images into pixels or instances and a discrete choice model to investigate peopleâ€™s preferences regarding BE features in residential location choices. Studying what visual features of the BE affect residential location choices in which way and how people trade off between BE features will offer valuable insights into residential area designs.
