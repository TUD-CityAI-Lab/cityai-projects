## Master Projects
Here, TUD students can find opportunities for doing their master thesis project at the CityAI Lab.

### Openings

Slots for the supervision of MSc students usually fill up rapidly (especially in Q3). But we are always looking for highly motivated students who want to work with us on the intersections between (travel) behaviour modelling, machine learning, and urban (mobility) analytics.

The ideal student for an MSc project at CityAI Lab has:

- Knowledge of machine learning
- Knowledge of the domain of application, such as travel behaviour, transport system, etc.
- Relevant programming skills (e.g. Python, R, Matlab)

The table below provides an overview of topics that would generally fit within the research at the CityAI Lab.
