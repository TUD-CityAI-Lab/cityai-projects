    <p>
In the Netherlands, several policies have been put in place to encourage a shift from freight road transportation to the less carbon-intensive alternatives of rail and inland waterways. A modal split model is needed to assess the potential impact of such policy interventions on freight mode choice. These models typically employ a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model which is straightforward to develop, transparent, and easily interpretable but suffers from low prediction accuracy if the initial assumptions made are incorrect. Currently, the potential of machine learning for more accurate freight mode choice predictions is still being explored. In my thesis, I will develop several machine learning models to predict freight transportation mode choice. I will compare and discuss the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the various models to determine whether machine learning could serve as an alternative or complement to the MNL model in NEAC, a European freight transport model. I will also explore whether other factors that affect freight decision-making could be included in the models using external data sources to further enhance the modelsâ€™ accuracy. More accurate modal split models could lead to better policy recommendations, supporting both urban and regional sustainability goals by reducing road congestion and carbon emissions.
