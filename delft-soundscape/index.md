## Do you want to participate in Delft's soundscape study by installing a noise sensor?

Noise pollution is a huge burden for citizens in the urban environment. Not only does noise cause stress and annoyance, but it also contributes to negative health outcomes such as heart disease and sleeping problems. To mitigate noise, one must understand the soundscape of our cities. While traffic noise is often perceived as a nuisance, bird song may have a restorative effect on our well-being. Therefore, we want to not only measure sound levels in Delft but also detect sound sources, such as traffic, birds, ambulances, crowds, etc. For this, **we need the help of citizens who are willing to install a noise sensor outside their homes.**

### How it works
{: #how}
The soundscape sensor was developed at TU Delft. The devices are solar-powered and do not need access to power. With your help, we can gather valuable information about the sounds of Delft.

**What do we measure?**
 - **Loudness (dB(A))**: This tells us how loud it is, using decibels adjusted to human hearing.
 - **Sound Source Detection**: Our sensor recognizes whether the noise comes from traffic, birds, people, or other sources.
 - **Intermittency Ratio**: This helps us understand if the noise is constant (like steady traffic) or comes in bursts (like a single passing scooter).
 - **Sharpness**: Sharpness is similar to the pitch of a sound. Specifically, it reflects the amount of high-frequency components.

**What you need to know**
 - Together, **we will find a suitable location** to mount the sensor, such as a rain pipe, fence, or balcony.
 - Our team will **install the sensor for you** to ensure proper setup.
 - The sensor will remain installed for about **4â€“5 weeks**.
 - We will also kindly ask you to fill in a **short survey** on noise annoyance.
 - After completion of the project, youâ€™ll **receive a report summarizing the noise characteristics** at your location.

ðŸ’¡ Privacy notice: The **sensors DO NOT record any raw audio**. We only measure characteristics of the sound, which makes it impossible to extract any personal information, such as spoken words.

ðŸ“¢ Your **neighbourhood does not need to be particularly noisy** to participate. We are interested in both pleasant and unpleasant soundscapes.
