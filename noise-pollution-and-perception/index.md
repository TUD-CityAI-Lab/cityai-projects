## Listening to our Cities: Using Smart Sensors and Machine Learning to Study Urban Noise Pollution

The sound of urban environments is often dominated by noise from transportation and residents, with profound effects on health and wellbeing. Higher noise exposure has been correlated with higher stress levels, sleep disruptions and cardiovascular diseases. In order to understand and mitigate noise pollution in the urban environment, sophisticated information on the local soundscape is neccessary. Current noise mapping efforts are often based on averaged sound levels for day, evening, and night time. While such aggregations are widely available and simplify noise mapping, they do not capture many aspects of the human perception of noise. For example, a constant background noise may have different effects than high-peak noise events, yet both could result in the same averaged sound level. Furthermore, such measures only account for the perceived loudness, but ignore other knowledge on the perception of sound, such as roughness, or perceived annoyance.

The goal of this project is to develop techniques for holistic noise maps, which takes into account how we as humans perceive urban noise. For this purpose, we are developing smart sensors, which utilize edge processing and machine learning to predict the source of noise events, and its perception based on various noise metrics. The audio signal is directly processed on the device, to ensure the privacy of the public. Furthermore, the sensor is self-sufficient and powered by battery and solar power, making it easy to use for real-world research. We plan to deploy a large array of such sensors to understand how our cities shape the sounds around us. In a later step, the recorded noise metrics will be used to develop a predictive model, allowing to estimate the urban soundscape of other cities based on ubiquitous data on the road networks, built environment and neighbourhood characteristics.
