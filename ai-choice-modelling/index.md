## Understanding, automating, and assisting choice modeller's workflows through AI

<div class="row">

    <p>
    Discrete choice modelling is a robust modelling framework for understanding and forecasting human choice behaviour across various fields. These models are typically used to infer individual preferences, estimate consumersâ€™ willingness to pay, generate behavioural insights that inform policy decisions. Unlike traditional approach, this research is considered as an art form. This perspective arise from the need to blend formal behavioural theories, statistical methodologies, and the judgments of choice modellers up to reporting results in the iterative journey from data collection trough descriptive analysis, models specification, outcome interpretation to the reporting of the results.

    While the literature on Choice modelling offers extensive knowledge about diverse modelling approaches, it falls short in fully capturing the decision-making process that modellers undertake across research phases. These decisions significantly influence the modelling results, especially as modellers have degrees of freedom in choosing, adjusting, and interpreting model specifications based on analyses carried out in previous phases. Although this flexibility promotes exploration and efficient methodological progress, it also carries the risk of poor decisions, limits reproducibility, and hamper discussion about good practices in the community.

    To address these research gaps, our first project introduces the <strong><a href="http://dcm-serious-game.tudelft.nl/?Session_id=test">Serious Choice Modelling Game</a></strong>, which mimics the actual modelling process. This allows us to capture and analyse the decision-making processes of modellers during the descriptive data analysis, model specification, outcome interpretation, and reporting phases. Participants were asked to develop choice models using a stated preference dataset to inform policymakers about individual willingness-to-pay values. Their workflows reveal variability among the descriptive analysis approaches used, the way they navigate across model specifications, and the reported willingness-to-pay.

    Our second project aims to develop tools to support choice modellers in their process of finding model specifications that capture decision-makers' choice process. Extracting meaningful insights from such models then requires the careful selection of an appropriate specification, an iterative process that is often time-consuming due to the many modelling decisions involved. 
    </p>

    This project introduces a reinforcement learning framework, which formalises an agent-environment interaction to automate the model specification process in discrete choice models. This interaction is modelled as a Markov Decision Process, in which a Deep Q-Network agent sequentially takes actions to propose a model specification, while an environment performs the estimation process and returns feedback based on the modelling outcomes, as depicted in the below Figure:
